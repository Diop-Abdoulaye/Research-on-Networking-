## Cable and Wireless Data Transmission

This step focuses on how data moves between devices via LAN (wired) and Wi-Fi (wireless), and how to transfer files using Python over a local network.

###Research LAN vs. WAN, wired vs. wireless

Quick Summary:

LAN (Local Area Network):

Small area (e.g., home, office).

Devices are connected via Ethernet cable or Wi-Fi.

Fast and low-latency.


WAN (Wide Area Network):

Large area (e.g., Internet).

Connects multiple LANs over long distances.
Usually slower, requires ISPs.


Wired (Ethernet):

Stable, high-speed, no interference.

Needs physical cables.


Wireless (Wi-Fi):

Convenient, mobile.

Slightly more prone to interference or drops.

###Study how Python can send files/data over local networks

This uses:

Sockets (like our chat app).

File reading/writing in binary mode.

Optionally: use threading to handle multiple transfers.
