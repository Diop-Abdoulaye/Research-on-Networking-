NETWORKING LEARNING CHECKLIST

1. Understand Networking Fundamentals



[ ] Research: IP addresses, MAC addresses, TCP/UDP, DNS, ports.

[ ] Study how data moves through a network.

[ ] Read basic socket programming code in Python (socket module).

Mini Project:

[ ] Create a Python TCP client-server chat program.

[ ] Modify the chat app to support multiple clients using threading.


---

2. Cable and Wireless Data Transmission



[ ] Research LAN vs. WAN, wired vs. wireless connections.

[ ] Study how Python can send files/data over local networks.

Mini Project:

[ ] Build a local file transfer system using sockets.

[ ] Set up a Raspberry Pi to receive files over Wi-Fi and store them.


---

3. Network Device Communication



[ ] Study HTTP and REST APIs.

[ ] Learn how embedded devices expose data (ESP32, Pi servers, etc.).

[ ] Read code using requests and http.server in Python.

Mini Project:

[ ] Build a REST API in Python to receive sensor data.

[ ] Create a client on another device to send data to this API.


---

4. Network Scanning and Analysis



[ ] Research tools: ping, ipconfig/ifconfig, nmap, Wireshark.

[ ] Study Python network scanning with scapy.

Mini Project:

[ ] Write a Python script to scan devices on your local network.

[ ] Enhance it to identify the device type or open ports.


---

5. Ethical Hacking Introduction



[ ] Study: packet sniffing, man-in-the-middle (MITM), spoofing basics.

[ ] Research platforms like TryHackMe or OverTheWire for legal practice.

Mini Project:

[ ] Use scapy to sniff packets and extract simple info (e.g., IP addresses).

[ ] Simulate a MITM attack in a test network to intercept a message.


---

6. Embedded Systems as Network Nodes



[ ] Learn how microcontrollers use MQTT, HTTP, or sockets.

[ ] Read code examples of ESP32 sending data via Wi-Fi.

Mini Project:

[ ] Build a network of 2 ESP32s: one as sensor sender, one as display receiver.

[ ] Create a desktop Python program that connects and logs the data.
